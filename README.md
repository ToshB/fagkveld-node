Hvorfor er JavaScript hot? Hva er greia med Nodejs?

### Technology Radar January 2014

##### Node.js - Adopt

Node.js is a lightweight web container that is a strong option for development of micro services and as a server to mobile and single-page web applications. Due to the asynchronous nature of node.js, developers are turning to promise libraries to simplify their application code. As the use of promises mature within the node.js community, we expect to see more applications developed for node.js. For those teams that are reluctant to try node.js in production, it is still worthwhile to consider node.js for development tasks like running JavaScript tests outside of the browser or generating static web content from tools like CoffeeScript, SASS, and LESS.

##### Yeoman - Assess
Yeoman attempts to make web application developers more productive by simplifying activities like scaffold, build and package management. It is a collection of the tools Yo, Grunt and Bower that work well as a set.

##### Grunt.js - Trial
Several of our ThoughtWorks teams developing Node.js apps are using Grunt to automate most of the development activities like minification, compilation, and linting. Many of the common tasks are available as Grunt plugins. You can even programmatically generate the configuration if necessary.

### Introduksjon
Node.js dukket i januar 2011 opp Thoughtwork's techradar, og ble i januar i år endret til statusen Adopt.

Mange store selskaper har hatt suksess med Node.js, blant annet LinkedIn, eBay, Walmart, Groupon, Netflix, HBO. Selv Microsoft har etter hvert begynt å tilby god støtte for Node.js i Visual Studio, bruker det internt, og
